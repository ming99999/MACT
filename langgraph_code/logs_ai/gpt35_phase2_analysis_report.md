# GPT-3.5-turbo Phase 2 Test Results Analysis

**Test File:** `predictions_gpt-3.5-turbo_mmqa_samples_20250929_205916.jsonl`
**Total Test Cases:** 21
**Test Date:** September 29, 2025

## Executive Summary

The GPT-3.5-turbo model showed **extremely poor performance** in Phase 2 testing with **0% accuracy** and significant operational failures. Nearly half of all questions (47.6%) resulted in immediate termination with placeholder answers, indicating fundamental issues with the reasoning and execution pipeline.

## 1. Questions with 0 Steps (Immediate Finish Actions)

**Count:** 10 out of 21 questions (47.6%)

These questions bypassed the multi-step reasoning process entirely and provided generic placeholder answers:

### Zero-Step Questions:
- **Q1:** Department budget ranking query → "Department A ($8B), Department B ($6B)"
- **Q2:** Average age calculation → "48.67"
- **Q5:** City population and competition query → "City X"
- **Q9:** City name for MTV Cube theme → "Official Name of the city..."
- **Q11:** City name for MTV Cube theme → "Los Angeles"
- **Q12:** Course registration query → "List of course names"
- **Q14:** Mobile number lookup → "Retrieved mobile number"
- **Q15:** Email address lookup → "insert email address"
- **Q16:** Student attendance query → "List of students who attended..."
- **Q18:** Course registration query → "Course A, Course B"

**Pattern:** The model appears to generate template-style answers without attempting actual data retrieval or analysis.

## 2. Overall Accuracy

**Accuracy Rate:** 0 out of 21 questions (0.0%)

**Critical Finding:** Not a single question was answered correctly, indicating complete system failure in data processing and reasoning.

## 3. Average Steps Taken

**Average:** 1.90 steps per question

### Step Distribution:
- **0 steps:** 10 cases (47.6%) - Immediate failures
- **1 step:** 2 cases (9.5%) - Minimal processing
- **2 steps:** 2 cases (9.5%) - Brief attempts
- **4 steps:** 1 case (4.8%) - Moderate processing
- **5 steps:** 6 cases (28.6%) - Maximum attempts before timeout

## 4. Most Common Failure Patterns

### Primary Failure Types:

1. **JOIN Operation Failures:** 25 occurrences
   - Most critical issue affecting data integration
   - Primarily due to column name mismatches ('department_ID' vs 'Department_ID', 'Host_city_ID' vs 'host_city_id')

2. **General Operation Failures:** 39 occurrences
   - Broad category including all operation-level failures
   - Indicates fundamental issues with code generation and execution

3. **Timeout Failures (Max Steps):** 6 cases (28.6%)
   - Questions Q4, Q6, Q8, Q10, Q19, Q20
   - All resulted in "Unable to determine answer"
   - Average execution time for timeouts: 29.87 seconds

4. **Calculation Errors:** 4 occurrences
   - Python runtime errors: 'max' function not defined, 'df' variable not defined
   - Indicates issues with generated code quality

5. **"Unable to Determine" Responses:** 6 cases
   - Direct admission of failure by the system
   - All corresponded with timeout scenarios

## 5. Data Retrieval vs Failed JOINs Analysis

### Critical Infrastructure Failures:

- **Successful Data Retrievals:** 0 out of 21 (0.0%)
- **Failed JOINs:** 7 out of 21 (33.3%)
- **Successful Operations:** 0 out of 21 (0.0%)

**Key Issue:** Complete failure in basic data operations, with no successful retrievals or operations recorded.

### Specific JOIN Error Patterns:
- **'department_ID' errors:** Multiple cases in department-related queries
- **'Host_city_ID' errors:** Multiple cases in city/competition queries
- **Column case sensitivity:** System fails to handle case variations in column names

## 6. Question Category Performance

### By Domain:
- **Department-related:** 4 questions - All failed
- **City/Farm competition:** 8 questions - All failed
- **Student/Course:** 7 questions - All failed
- **People/Candidate:** 2 questions - All failed

**Pattern:** Failure is consistent across all domain types, indicating systemic rather than domain-specific issues.

## 7. Performance Metrics

### Execution Time Analysis:
- **Average:** 14.37 seconds
- **Maximum:** 35.54 seconds (Q6 - timeout case)
- **Minimum:** 4.19 seconds (Q2 - immediate finish)
- **Timeout cases average:** 29.87 seconds

### Confidence Analysis:
- **Average confidence:** 0.57
- **High confidence (≥0.8):** 15 out of 21 (71.4%)
- **Zero confidence:** 6 out of 21 (28.6%)

**Paradox:** Despite 0% accuracy, the model expressed high confidence in 71.4% of cases, indicating poor self-assessment capabilities.

## 8. Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **Column Name Matching Failures**
   - Case sensitivity issues ('department_ID' vs 'Department_ID')
   - Inconsistent column name handling across tables

2. **Code Generation Quality**
   - Python syntax errors (parenthesis mismatches)
   - Undefined variable references ('df', 'max' function)
   - Empty result handling failures

3. **Reasoning Pipeline Breakdown**
   - 47.6% immediate termination suggests reasoning system failure
   - Template answer generation instead of data-driven responses

4. **JOIN Operation Implementation**
   - Fundamental issues with table joining logic
   - No successful JOIN operations recorded across all tests

## 9. Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix Column Name Handling**
   - Implement case-insensitive column matching
   - Add robust column name normalization

2. **Improve Code Generation**
   - Add syntax validation before execution
   - Implement proper variable scoping and function imports

3. **Enhance Reasoning Pipeline**
   - Debug immediate termination logic
   - Ensure multi-step reasoning is engaged for all appropriate queries

4. **JOIN Operation Overhaul**
   - Complete rewrite of table joining functionality
   - Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms

5. **Add Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for each operation type
   - Integration tests for multi-step reasoning
   - Validation of code generation quality

## Conclusion

The GPT-3.5-turbo Phase 2 results represent a **complete system failure** with no successful question answering. The combination of immediate terminations (47.6%), JOIN failures (33.3%), and 0% accuracy indicates fundamental architectural issues that must be addressed before any meaningful evaluation can proceed.

**Priority:** Critical - System requires major debugging and architectural fixes before further testing.
