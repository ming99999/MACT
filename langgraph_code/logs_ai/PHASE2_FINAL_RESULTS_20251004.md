## üìù Detailed Test History

### Phase 2 Native (Commit: 38bcaa6)
**Date**: 2025-10-04 09:54
**Changes**:
- Added `intermediate_tables` field to state
- Created `df_context.py` with `build_df_context()`
- Modified Retrieve: use `include_intermediate=False`
- Modified Operator: use `include_intermediate=True`
- Enhanced prompts with intermediate hints and FK guidance

**Results**: **14.3% accuracy** (3/21)
- Avg steps: 3.10 (vs 3.76 in Phase 1)
- **5 questions terminated at step 1** (vs 0 in Phase 1)
- Execution time: 261.5s (50% faster but less accurate)
- False confidence: 0.61 avg (vs 0.457 in Phase 1)

**Failure Analysis**:
- Premature termination epidemic
- Prompt complexity overload
- Infrastructure overhead without benefit

### Option 2: Simplified (Commit: 5324344)
**Date**: 2025-10-04 10:15
**Changes**:
- Disabled intermediate table usage (`include_intermediate=False` everywhere)
- Removed intermediate hints from prompts
- Simplified FK hints

**Results**: **0.0% accuracy** (0/21) - CRITICAL FAILURE
- All questions: Steps = 0, "Error occurred during execution"
- Initialization failure in `build_df_context()`
- Complete system breakdown

**Failure Analysis**:
- `build_df_context()` infrastructure itself has bugs
- Not just prompt complexity - fundamental issues
- Made things WORSE, not better

### Option 3: Rollback to Phase 1 (Commit: 72809f2)
**Date**: 2025-10-04 10:25
**Changes**:
- Complete rollback to Phase 1 Revised
- Removed ALL Phase 2 code
- Kept Phase 1 enhancements (Batch API, Hybrid voting, Bug fixes)

**Results**: **28.6% accuracy** (6/21) - SUCCESS ‚úÖ
- Fully functional, no errors
- Restored to Phase 1 performance level
- Slightly lower than Phase 1 Hybrid (33.3%) but within acceptable variance

## üí° Key Findings

### Why Phase 2 Failed

1. **Infrastructure Complexity ‚Üí Performance Degradation**
   - `build_df_context()` created overly complex DataFrame setup
   - Variable renaming (`df` ‚Üí `df1`, `df2`) confused LLM
   - Conditional context inclusion added cognitive load

2. **Prompt Overload**
   - Intermediate hints + FK hints + examples = too much
   - gpt-3.5-turbo couldn't handle the complexity
   - Simpler prompts (Phase 1) work better

3. **Premature Termination**
   - 5 questions terminated at step 1 in Phase 2 Native
   - Lost opportunity for multi-step reasoning
   - Suggests fundamental logic issues

4. **False Confidence**
   - Phase 2 had HIGHER confidence (0.61) but LOWER accuracy (14.3%)
   - System was overconfident in wrong answers
   - Indicates quality degradation, not just tuning issue

### What We Learned

1. **"Perfect Infrastructure ‚â† Better Performance"**
   - Phase 2 was technically correct but practically useless
   - Simplicity often beats sophistication for LLM tasks

2. **Test Full Dataset Early**
   - Integration test (1 question) showed infrastructure worked
   - But didn't predict massive performance drop on full dataset
   - Need comprehensive testing before concluding success

3. **LLM Sensitivity to Context**
   - Small changes in DataFrame setup ‚Üí huge accuracy drop
   - gpt-3.5-turbo very sensitive to prompt structure
   - Keeping prompts simple and direct is critical

4. **Rollback is a Valid Strategy**
   - Better to admit failure and return to known-good state
   - Than to keep struggling with broken approach
   - Phase 1 Revised (28.6%) >> Phase 2 (14.3%)

## üéØ Final Decision

### ADOPT: Phase 1 Revised (28.6%)

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ Stable and functional
- ‚úÖ Reasonable accuracy (2√ó better than Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ No execution errors
- ‚úÖ Proven track record

**Commit**: `72809f2` - Phase 1 Revised: Batch API + Hybrid Voting

**Features Included**:
1. Batch API for code generation (`generate_code_batch`)
2. Hybrid voting (tool results + LLM observations)
3. Bug Fix #1: FK hints and normalized column handling
4. Bug Fix #2: Multi-table detection
5. Bug Fix #3: First-step Finish validation

### ABANDON: All Phase 2 Approaches

**Phase 2 Native**: 14.3% - Infrastructure too complex
**Option 2**: 0.0% - Complete failure
**Option 3**: Led us back to Phase 1

## üîÑ Future Directions

Instead of pursuing table state propagation, focus on:

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Simplify and clarify instructions
   - Reduce cognitive load
   - Test incrementally

2. **Stronger Models**
   - Test with gpt-4 (better reasoning)
   - Test with Claude (better code generation)
   - Compare performance across models

3. **Incremental Improvements**
   - Small, testable changes
   - Validate each change on full dataset
   - Don't assume infrastructure correctness = performance

4. **Different Approaches**
   - Maybe table state propagation isn't the solution
   - Consider other MACT enhancements
   - Or focus on non-MACT approaches
