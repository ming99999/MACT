## Error Pattern Analysis

### Baseline Errors (7 total, 33.3%)

All baseline errors were **zero-step termination cases** where the system crashed before completing any steps:

- **Q3**: Zero-step crash → 2 steps, ❌ incorrect
- **Q6**: Zero-step crash → 4 steps, ❌ incorrect
- **Q12**: Zero-step crash → 5 steps, ❌ incorrect
- **Q15**: Zero-step crash → 5 steps, ❌ incorrect
- **Q16**: Zero-step crash → 5 steps, ❌ incorrect
- **Q17**: Zero-step crash → 4 steps, ❌ incorrect
- **Q19**: Zero-step crash → 4 steps, ✅ CORRECT


### Fixed Version Errors (0 total, 0.0%)

✅ **All errors eliminated!** This is a major stability improvement.

### Error Elimination Impact

The bug fixes successfully addressed:
1. **Bug #3 (Zero-step termination)**: 7/7 cases fixed (100%)
2. **Bug #1 (Multi-table retrieval)**: Deployed in 15/21 questions (71%)
3. **Bug #2 (Type coercion)**: Enabled successful operations in 20/21 questions (95%)

However, error elimination alone didn't guarantee correct answers:
- Only 1/6 error-fixed questions became correct (Q19)
- 5/6 still produce incorrect answers but now do so gracefully

## Step Count Analysis

### Why Did Average Steps Increase 58%?

**Baseline: 2.14 steps/question → Fixed: 3.38 steps/question (+1.24)**


| Steps | Baseline Count | Fixed Count | Change |
|-------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | 7 | 0 | -7 |
| 1 | 4 | 4 | +0 |
| 2 | 2 | 3 | +1 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 | +3 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 | +0 |
| 5 | 5 | 8 | +3 |


**Key Insights:**

1. **Zero-step elimination**: 7 questions moved from 0 steps to 2-5 steps
2. **More thorough execution**: Questions that previously terminated early now explore more
3. **Complex questions**: Student/Course category saw largest increase (1.22→3.78 steps)
4. **Efficiency loss**: Some questions that worked in 1 step now take 5 steps (Q13, Q15, Q16)

**Possible Causes:**
- Multi-table retrieval fix may require additional operator steps
- More robust error handling prevents premature termination
- System now explores alternative paths when initial attempts fail

## Regression Analysis

### Why Did 3 Questions Regress?


#### Q5: What are the names of cities or villages with populations below 2000 that hosted farm competitions b...

- **Baseline:** ✅ Correct with 2 steps
- **Fixed:** ❌ Incorrect with 3 steps
- **Predicted:** Perth-Andover, Plaster Rock, Drummond, Aroostook
- **Expected:** Plaster Rock, Drummond, Aroostook
- **Issue:** Extra city included (Perth-Andover) - possible filter logic change
#### Q8: What are the names of the cities which hosted farm competitions after 2005 and have an area larger t...

- **Baseline:** ✅ Correct with 5 steps
- **Fixed:** ❌ Incorrect with 1 steps
- **Predicted:** Perth-Andover, Drummond
- **Expected:** Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, Perth-Andover, Drummond
- **Issue:** Missing city (Grand Falls/Grand-Sault) - possible aggregation issue
#### Q20: Which student has registered for both courses 301 and 302?...

- **Baseline:** ✅ Correct with 4 steps
- **Fixed:** ❌ Incorrect with 2 steps
- **Predicted:** Student 141, Nikhil
- **Expected:** Nikhil
- **Issue:** Returning extra information (ID + name instead of just name)

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**

The bug fixes changed the execution path for some questions. Specifically:
1. Multi-table retrieval fix may alter join/filter logic
2. Type coercion fix may change how pandas operations handle edge cases
3. More steps doesn't guarantee better answers - may indicate exploration of wrong paths

**Recommendation:** These regressions need individual investigation to understand the changed behavior.

## Conclusions

### What Worked ✅

1. **Structural Stability:** All errors eliminated - system is now crash-free
2. **Zero-step Fix:** Complete success - no premature terminations
3. **Multi-table Retrieval:** Successfully deployed and improved Q1
4. **Error Recovery:** 2 questions improved to correct (Q1, Q19)
5. **Confidence Calibration:** Average confidence increased to 0.57

### What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Accuracy Regression:** 19.0% → 14.3% (-4.8pp) despite fixes
2. **City Category:** Significant regression (37.5% → 12.5%)
3. **Efficiency:** 58% more steps but no accuracy gain
4. **Answer Quality:** Most error-fixed questions still produce wrong answers
5. **Format Issues:** Some questions return wrong data format (IDs instead of names)

### Critical Issues to Address

1. **Regression Investigation:** Debug Q5, Q8, Q20 to understand why fixes caused regressions
2. **Answer Format:** System returns wrong data types (IDs instead of names, extra fields)
3. **Aggregation Logic:** Questions requiring joins/filters/aggregations are struggling
4. **Lookup Failures:** Q12, Q15, Q16 return "Unable to determine" despite no errors

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Debug Regressions:** Investigate Q5, Q8, Q20 execution logs to find changed logic
2. **Format Validation:** Add answer format checking to ensure correct data types
3. **Query Analysis:** Review SQL queries for Q12, Q15, Q16 to fix lookup failures

### Short-term Improvements

4. **Step Efficiency:** Optimize execution to reduce unnecessary step increases
5. **Aggregation Logic:** Review operator logic for join/filter/aggregation correctness
6. **Confidence Calibration:** System is overconfident (0.57) given low accuracy (14.3%)

### Long-term Strategy

7. **Answer Validation:** Add final answer validation step before returning result
8. **Execution Path Analysis:** Log why certain execution paths are chosen
9. **Test Coverage:** Create regression test suite to prevent future regressions
10. **Model Tuning:** Consider different models or prompts for better reasoning

---

## Summary

The bug fixes accomplished their primary goal: **eliminating execution errors and stabilizing the system**. This is a critical foundation for future improvements. However, the unexpected accuracy regression reveals that:

1. **Stability ≠ Correctness:** A crash-free system can still produce wrong answers
2. **Bug fixes changed behavior:** The fixes altered execution paths in ways that helped some questions but hurt others
3. **More investigation needed:** The regressions suggest the fixes exposed or introduced new logic issues

**Overall Assessment:** This is a **mixed success**. The structural improvements are valuable, but we need to understand and fix the regressions before claiming overall improvement. The elimination of all errors is significant progress toward a production-ready system.
